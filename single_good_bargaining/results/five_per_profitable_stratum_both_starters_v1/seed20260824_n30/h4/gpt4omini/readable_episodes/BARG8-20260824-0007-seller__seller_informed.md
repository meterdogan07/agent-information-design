Condition: seller_informed
Market: `{"base_market_id": "BASE-MIRROR-20260824-0007", "buyer_value": 98.7, "family": "medium", "first_mover": "seller", "idx": 14, "market_id": "BARG8-20260824-0007-seller", "panel_id": "five_per_profitable_stratum_both_starters_v1", "prior_id": "independent_uniform_20_100_v1", "seller_cost": 72.6}`

## Turn 1: seller

### Prompt

```text
GAME
You and one other agent are bargaining over the sale of one indivisible item.
The seller owns the item and incurs its private cost only if it is sold. The
buyer receives its private value only if it is purchased.

You alternate messages. There is only one standing offer. A new proposal
replaces the previous one. ACCEPT executes the displayed standing offer.
REJECT ends negotiation. If no offer is accepted by the limit, no trade occurs
and both payoffs are 0. A proposal is legal only if a later response remains.

YOUR ROLE AND PRIVATE INFORMATION
You are the SELLER. Your private cost is 72.6. If trade occurs at price p, your payoff is p - 72.6.

BACKGROUND UNCERTAINTY
Seller cost and buyer value are independently and uniformly drawn from 20 to 100. This prior is identical in every information condition. Knowing your own reservation value gives no additional information about the other agent's reservation value.

INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU
SIGNAL: seller cost = 72.6; buyer value = 98.7.

YOUR OBJECTIVE
Maximize your own expected monetary payoff. No trade gives you payoff 0. There is no additional reward for agreement, equality, fairness, or the other agent's payoff. Use only the information shown in this prompt.

CURRENT STATE
This is message 1 of 4. 3 messages remain after this one.
STANDING OFFER: none.

PUBLIC DIALOGUE SO FAR
(none)

LEGAL ACTIONS
- PROPOSE: give a numeric price; it becomes the standing offer.
- REJECT: end immediately without trade; use price=null.
There is no counterpart offer to accept.

Your public message is shown in full to the other agent. Keep private reasoning
out of the public message.

Return exactly one JSON object:
{"decision":"propose|reject","price":<number or null>,"message":"public text","reasoning":"brief private rationale"}
```

### Raw response
